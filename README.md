## Background

I analysing financial records for Pybanks and observe all scenarios of ranges

* Total schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average maths score
* Average reading score
* % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

### School Summary

Create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school, including the following:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average maths score
* Average reading score
* % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

I Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average maths score
* Average reading score
* % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average maths score
* Average reading score
* % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### Maths Scores by Year

created  DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Year

Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average maths score
* Average reading score
* % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### Scores by School Size

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

### Scores by School Type
